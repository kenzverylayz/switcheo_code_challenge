1. The `FormattedWalletBalance` interface can be simplified to extend the `WalletBalance` interface since the only additional attribute is "formatted: string." This would eliminate redundant code.

2. Typecasting the `Blockchain` parameter as `any` in the `getPriority` function is problematic as it could introduce bugs in the code. If `Blockchain` can accept various types (e.g., strings, integers, or floats), when it's expected to be only a specific type, it may lead to unexpected issues in the program.

3. In the `WalletBalance` interface, the `blockchain` property is not explicitly defined, which could lead to inconsistencies or errors. It should be included in the interface definition.

4. Combining the mapping of `sortedBalances` into both `formattedBalances` and `rows` into a single `map` operation is a more efficient approach. This way, a `formattedBalance` object is created for each `balance` element, followed by the immediate creation of the corresponding `WalletRow` component, avoiding unnecessary iteration over `sortedBalances`.

5. I have included relevant import statements for `useHook`, `useMemo`, and `useState`.

6. Depending on the sorting logic of `sortedBalances`, `getPriority` could be included as a dependency in the `useMemo` hook. However, in this case, I decided to omit it because it doesn't appear to be a dynamic function that changes during runtime.

7. The logic for sorting `sortedBalances` doesn't account for cases where priorities are equal. I have added a case for when priorities are equal, returning 0 to ensure proper sorting.

8. Initializing the `prices` state as an empty object may lead to type-related issues. I have provided a specific type in the `useState` declaration to ensure type safety.

9. In the `useEffect` hook, relevant dependencies could be included if needed. However, as I am unsure of what to add for now, I have left it as an empty array.

10. Lastly, it's assumed that `useWalletBalances` and `BoxProps` are defined elsewhere in the codebase, as they are not provided in the provided code snippet.
